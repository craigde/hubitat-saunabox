# Blebox Saunabox Driver for Hubitat

A Hubitat Elevation driver for controlling and monitoring Blebox SaunaBox devices. This driver provides full thermostat integration, automatic safety shutoff, and intelligent polling to seamlessly integrate your sauna into your smart home.

## Overview

The Blebox SaunaBox is a WiFi-enabled controller that turns any traditional sauna into a smart sauna. This Hubitat driver allows you to:

- **Control your sauna** remotely from Hubitat dashboards, rules, and apps
- **Monitor temperature** in real-time with automatic updates
- **Set target temperatures** for your sauna sessions
- **Automatic safety shutoff** - never worry about leaving the sauna on
- **Works with physical controls** - detects and responds to manual button presses
- **Dashboard integration** - displays as a thermostat with full control

## Quick Start Configuration

### Recommended Settings for Most Users

```
SaunaBox IP: [Your SaunaBox IP address]
Default temp: 170°F (or your preference)
Auto shutoff timer: 60 minutes
Polling interval when OFF: 5 minutes
Timer compensation: Conservative
Use Imperial units: Yes (for Fahrenheit)
Debug mode: No
```

These settings provide:
- ✅ Good safety margin (never runs more than ~60 minutes)
- ✅ Quick detection of external turn-ons (within 5 minutes)
- ✅ Minimal network load
- ✅ Predictable behavior

## Basic Usage

### From Hubitat Dashboard

Add your sauna device to a dashboard using the **Thermostat** template:
- **Temperature** - Current sauna temperature
- **Setpoint** - Target temperature
- **Mode** - Heat (on) or Off
- **Operating State** - Heating or Idle

### From Rules & Automations

Use the sauna in Hubitat rules:
```
Trigger: Time is 6:00 PM
Action: Set Sauna to Heat mode
Action: Set Sauna temperature to 170°F
```

```
Trigger: Sauna temperature >= 165°F
Action: Send notification "Sauna is ready!"
```

```
Trigger: Nobody home
Action: Set Sauna to Off mode
```

### Voice Control (via Hubitat integrations)

If you have Alexa or Google Home integrated:
- "Alexa, turn on the sauna"
- "Hey Google, set the sauna to 180 degrees"
- "Alexa, what's the sauna temperature?"

## Understanding Auto-Shutoff & Timer Compensation

### The Challenge

When you turn on your sauna using the physical button (or external app), the Hubitat driver doesn't know immediately. It only discovers the sauna is on during the next polling cycle, which could be up to [polling interval] minutes later.

**Example without compensation:**
- 3:00 PM - Press physical button
- 3:14 PM - Driver detects it's on (14 minutes later)
- 3:14 PM - Timer starts for 60 minutes
- 4:14 PM - Sauna turns off
- **Total runtime: 74 minutes** (14 minutes over!)

### The Solution: Timer Compensation

The driver can compensate for this detection delay by adjusting the timer:

#### Conservative (Recommended)
- Subtracts the **full polling interval** from the timer
- Guarantees sauna never runs over intended time
- May run slightly short if detected quickly
- **Best for safety-conscious users**

#### Balanced
- Subtracts **half the polling interval** from the timer
- Averages out across multiple uses
- May run slightly over or under
- **Best for accuracy-focused users**

#### None
- Uses full timer regardless of detection delay
- User always gets full intended runtime
- May run over by up to [polling interval]
- **Only use with fast polling (1-5 min)**

### Example with Compensation

**Settings:** 60-min auto-off, 5-min polling, Conservative

- 3:00 PM - Press physical button
- 3:03 PM - Driver detects it's on (3 minutes later)
- 3:03 PM - Timer starts for 55 minutes (60 - 5)
- 3:58 PM - Sauna turns off
- **Total runtime: 58 minutes** (safe! ✅)

## Configuration Guide

### Polling Intervals

Choose based on your priorities:

| Interval | Detection Delay | Network Load | Best For |
|----------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| 1 minute | < 1 min | High | Maximum responsiveness |
| **5 minutes** | **< 5 min** | **Low** | **Most users (recommended)** |
| 10 minutes | < 10 min | Very Low | Balanced efficiency |
| 15 minutes | < 15 min | Minimal | Network-conscious |
| 30 minutes | < 30 min | Minimal | Not recommended |

### Auto-Shutoff Duration

Typical ranges:
- **30-45 minutes**: Quick sessions, gym/club saunas
- **60 minutes**: Standard home sauna sessions (recommended)
- **90-120 minutes**: Extended sessions, social gatherings

Tip: If using Conservative compensation with longer polling, increase the auto-shutoff time by 5-10 minutes to account for the timer reduction.

### Compensation Strategies

| Strategy | Runtime Behavior | Trade-off |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Conservative** | 55-60 min (5-min poll) | Safety over precision |
| Balanced | 57.5-62.5 min (5-min poll) | Precision over guarantee |
| None | 60-65 min (5-min poll) | Comfort over safety |

## Troubleshooting

### Sauna Not Responding

1. Verify SaunaBox IP address is correct
2. Check that SaunaBox is on your network
3. Ping the SaunaBox IP from a computer
4. Check hub logs for error messages
5. Try the SaunaBox's web interface directly

### Temperature Not Updating

1. Check that sauna is ON (should poll every 1 minute when on)
2. Enable debug logging in preferences
3. Check logs during next polling cycle
4. Verify SaunaBox API is responding

### Timer Not Working

1. Check logs for timer start/stop messages
2. Verify auto-shutoff timer setting is not 0
3. Test by turning on sauna and watching for auto-shutoff
4. Check that timer cancels when turned off manually

### Detection Too Slow

1. Decrease polling interval (try 5 minutes)
2. Check network latency to SaunaBox
3. Verify hub schedule is running (check logs)

### Running Too Short/Long

**If running too short:**
- Increase auto-shutoff duration by 5-10 minutes, OR
- Change compensation to Balanced, OR
- Decrease polling interval

**If running too long:**
- Use Conservative compensation, OR
- Decrease polling interval, OR
- Check that timer is actually starting (enable debug logs)

## Advanced Features

## Technical Details

### What Got Fixed

#### Bug 1: Auto-Shutoff Timer
**Problem**: Timer only worked when turned on via driver, didn't work with physical button
**Solution**: 
- Added state change detection in polling function
- Timer starts for ANY turn-on event (driver or external)
- Timer properly cancels for ANY turn-off event
- Added intelligent compensation for external turn-ons

#### Bug 2: Polling Frequency
**Problem**: Polling didn't switch between fast/slow based on state
**Solution**:
- Created centralized polling schedule function
- Properly cancels existing schedules before creating new ones
- Detects external state changes and adjusts accordingly
- Uses actual device state instead of non-existent state variables

#### Bug 3: Temperature Updates
**Problem**: Temperature not updating frequently when sauna was on
**Solution**: 
- Fixed polling schedule switching
- Ensures 1-minute polling when heating
- Immediate schedule update on state change

### API Integration

The driver communicates with the SaunaBox API:
- **Status endpoint**: `/api/heat/extended/state` - Get current state
- **Control endpoints**: 
  - `/s/0` - Turn off
  - `/s/1` - Turn on
  - `/s/t/[temp]` - Set temperature (in format XXXX = XX.XX°C)

Temperature conversion:
- SaunaBox uses format: `XXXX` = `XX.XX°C`
- Driver handles Fahrenheit/Celsius conversion
- Example: 170°F → 76.67°C → 7667 (API format)

### Polling Behavior

**When OFF:** Configurable interval (1, 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes)
**When ON:** Fixed 1-minute interval
**Transition:** Immediate when state change detected

### Network Load

Approximate requests per day:
- **OFF (5 min)**: 288 requests/day
- **OFF (15 min)**: 96 requests/day
- **ON (always 1 min)**: 1,440 requests/day

Each request is a lightweight HTTP GET (~200 bytes response)
